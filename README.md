# WE ARE HIRING !!!

GreenWaves Technologies is a fabless semiconductor start-up designing disruptive ultra-low power embedded solutions for image, sound and vibration AI processing in sensing devices. GreenWaves was founded in late 2014 with the mission of revolutionizing the market for intelligent sensors and devices with ultra-low energy and cost-efficient solutions. GreenWaves’ GAP8 is the industry’s first ultra-low-power processor enabling battery-operated artificial intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The company is headquartered just outside Grenoble, France.

Our team comes from a wide range of backgrounds. We have many years of experience, in large and small companies, of bringing successful new-to-world products to market.

GreenWaves is one of a growing group of semiconductor design companies that are committing to Open Source projects. We believe that this both advances innovation and provides customers with confidence in their decision to commit to our products. We are actively participating in two Open Source projects that provide some of the components in GAP8’s design and without which GAP8 would not exist, the RISC V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and Parallel Ultra Low Power (PULP) projects.

Our team includes members from the two Universities working on the PULP program, ETH Zurich, Switzerland and UniBo, Bologna, Italy, and GreenWaves staff continue to feedback contributions into both the PULP and RISC-V communities.

Now we are hiring in China!!! Greenwaves Technologies, as a growing and highly multicultural team with sharp personalities, need talented, enthusiastic, curious and committed people who will be ready to bring energy into the system for a significant contribution to the success of the team project. Greenwaves Technology as a team is very proud of its specific collaborative management style. Our Technology is very much ahead of the state-of-art, and our chip is just about to prove its revolutionary potential on a wide opened global market. For a team, it is a very motivating challenge that each of us has the opportunity to be part of in proportion to our own enthusiasm at work. The company is and will be what we each of us make of it, as we experience it, every day.
